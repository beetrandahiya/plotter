# plotter
Plotter is a mathematics function grapher.<br>
<b>But</b><br>
You might ask <br>
" What is special about this one? There are a lot of such things out there." <br>
So I won't give you a huge explanation for why it's better because <br>
IT'S SIMPLE.

# Usage

The whole motive is - It's simple <br>

No complex values to set.<br>
No need to install something new.<br>
Just, Input a function, your desired domain <br>
and you'll get a beautiful graph for your function in the given domain.<br>

Ummm, okay, you dont like the color of the graph.<br>
NO , We don't have a 8 color pickup menu, where you can pick out of just a few colors<br>
Rather, You can choose literally any color you want.<br>

# Note
Plotter will be updated with new features very frequently. <br>
So, don't forget to follow.<br>
